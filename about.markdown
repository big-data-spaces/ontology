## Motivation

The Catena-X Namespace is a model and schema distribution channel.

Via this medium, semantic models, schemas and taxonomies are published in a versioned and both machine and human-readable 
manner.

The official domain redirecting the Catena-X namespace is <https://w3id.org/catenax>.
